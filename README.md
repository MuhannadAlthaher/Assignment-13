# Flutter Credit Card Input App

## Overview

This project is a Flutter-based mobile application that simulates a credit card data input form. The app allows users to input their card details, including the card number, expiry date, CVV, and cardholder name. Upon pressing the "Show card data" button, the app validates the inputs and displays the card information in a custom dialog with a gradient background.

## Features

- **Credit Card Input Form**: Users can input their card details using a structured form.
- **Input Validation**: The app checks if the card number is 16 digits, the expiry date is in the correct format, and the cardholder name is not empty.
- **Custom Dialog Display**: If the input is valid, the app displays the card information in a stylized dialog with a gradient background and optional image.
